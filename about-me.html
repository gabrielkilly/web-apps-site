                Born on St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands, I grew up in a place not known for its technological innovation, yet, it is where my passion for software development was first rooted. In high school, I had the rare opportunity to take computer science classes. I also became interested in web development — making websites for small businesses. In college, this passion has had the time and resources to blossom. I’ve had the opportunity to learn and experience many different aspects of the field: building web applications, working with embedded systems, and even trying my hand at machine learning. My goal is to continue learning about the software development process as a whole. Of course, this includes improving my skills as a programmer — writing concise, readable code and learning the best practices. However, it also includes developing a better understanding of the project planning/management process within a team.
